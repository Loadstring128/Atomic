# Your ROBLOSECURITY is your roblox authentication token, it gives Atomic full access to your account
# It's required for the bot to use your account to begin trading
ROBLOSECURITY = COOKIE_HERE

[ System ]

# If you're hosting Atomic on a vps, set this to linux
operating_system = windows

[ General ]

# How long to wait before updating item values (in minutes)
update_values = 35

# Limited items that you do not want to trade, separated by a comma.
# If you want it to trade with all items, set this to false
not_for_trade = 00000,11111

# Trades limited items by rap/value, we recommend keeping it at value
trade_by = value

# Time to wait before searching for a new user to trade with
time_between_trade = 13

# Maximum value of items to trade with, items that go beyond this value will be declined.
max_item_value = 5000

# The minimum amount of profit the bot should aim for in each trade. (Including inbound trades)
minimum_profit = 200

# The maximum items that Atomic will be able to offer/request, when for example set to 4/1, it'll be able to offer up to 4 items, but can only request 1 item (upgrading)
maximum_items_to_trade = 4/4

# Does not evaluate trades above this value
# You're welcome to increase it to however you please

# If set to false then the trade just gets declined

[ Other ]

# When set to true, Atomic will start caching completed trades, users, etc. This helps make Atomic run faster
# Caches can be cleared by deleting the `Cache` folder that gets created
