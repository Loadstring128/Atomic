# How to use

First, download the latest version of Atomic [here](https://github.com/viown/Atomic/releases) or compile it yourself from [these instructions](https://github.com/viown/Atomic/blob/master/Compiling.md)  

Once you've downloaded it, run Atomic.exe and a file named `config.cfg` or just `config` should've been created, open this file with notepad or any other text editor you have.  
The config is how you customize how the bot trades, but the config is already setup to work best for you.  

Atomic needs to be able to login to your account in order to start trading, the way it's done is through the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie, to get your roblosecurity cookie go to [roblox.com](https://www.roblox.com/home), and in the topbar you should see the padlock icon, click on it then go to `Cookies` -> roblox.com -> Cookies -> .ROBLOSECURITY, under it in `Content` is your ROBLOSECURITY cookie, double click it then press CTRL + C to copy it.  
From there, paste the ROBLOSECURITY cookie in your config's `ROBLOSECURITY` value, and that's all, save it then run Atomic again, the bot should start trading.
