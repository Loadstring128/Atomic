Atomic's TODO:

- The botting algorithm (obviously)
- A better demand calculator for non-assigned items
- roblox::getTrades(), possibly create a non-activated struct to prevent having to use std::async
- Support for trading with multiple roblox accounts at once (using threading)

IMPORTANT: For inbound trades: If an offer's rap is way too high than what is being requested and rolimons says the items are not projected, do a custom projected check on the items offered.
