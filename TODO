Atomic's TODO:

- The botting algorithm (obviously)
- A better demand calculator for non-assigned items
- Support for trading with multiple roblox accounts at once (using threading)
- Make a get inventory function that uses rolimon's https://www.rolimons.com/api/playerassets/{userid}

IMPORTANT: For inbound trades: If an offer's rap is way too high than what is being requested and rolimons says the items are not projected, do a custom projected check on the items offered.
