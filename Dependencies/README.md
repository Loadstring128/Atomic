# Dependencies

Libraries that Atomic uses

- [cpr](https://github.com/whoshuu/cpr) : Library used for HTTP methods
- [rapidjson](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson) : Library used for JSON parsing. Pre-included

If you wish, I recommend re-compiling all libraries yourself, however that's not necessary.
