# Compile

If you wish to compile Atomic yourself, get the latest open source version from [here](https://github.com/viown/Atomic/releases)  
Open Atomic.sln -> Set to Release build -> Build, all dependencies/libraries are already set up and available. Atomic will compile with default config settings.  
There should be a "Release" folder that has been created, open that and you'll find the executable.  

You must have Visual Studio 2019 and MSVC in order to compile this,  
if you don't, download [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) and after installation is complete open Visual Studio Installer (It should've been installed), you should find Visual Studio Community 2019 installed, click Modify then check `Desktop development with C++` then hit Modify, once it's installed you should be able to compile Atomic.
